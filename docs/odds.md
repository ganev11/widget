## Odds Entity Filters

When querying fixtures or odds, you can refine the results by applying specific keys to the `odds` entity scope. This allows you to limit the data returned to specific bookmakers, markets, or match states.

### Available Filter Keys for `odds`

| Key | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bookmakers` | Integer(s) | Filter by one or more Bookmaker IDs. |
| `markets` | Integer(s) | Filter by specific Market IDs (e.g., `1` for Match Winner). |
| `is_live` | Boolean (0/1) | `1` returns only In-Play odds; `0` returns only Pre-match odds. |
| `suspend` | Boolean (0/1) | `1` returns only suspended/locked odds; `0` returns only active odds. |

### Practical Examples

**1. Filter by specific Bookmaker and Markets**
To get odds only for Bookmaker **2** and only for **Match Winner (1)** or **Over/Under (3)**:
`?filter[odds]=bookmakers:2;markets:1,3`

**2. Filter for Active Pre-match Odds**
To get odds that are **not live** and are **not suspended**:
`?filter[odds]=is_live:0;suspend:0`

**3. Comprehensive Selection**
To get odds for **Bookmaker 2**, within **Market 203**, that are currently **Live** and **Active**:
`?filter[odds]=bookmakers:2;markets:203;is_live:1;suspend:0`

### Summary of Delimiter Logic for Odds
*   **OR Logic (Comma):** `markets:1,3` means "Market 1 **OR** Market 3".
*   **AND Logic (Semicolon):** `is_live:1;suspend:0` means "Must be Live **AND** Must be Not Suspended".
